# Dispatch Server
# Copyright (c) Akatsumekusa and contributors

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# These are the configs you will need to adjust based on your filtering
# vpy script and your system.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# This `necessary_cpu` parameter denotes the expected amount of CPU
# used for each worker. This is the percentage of the CPU used with
# `100` denoting fully utilising all CPU threads on the system.
# 
# You should set this number to match the CPU usage for filtering, or
# encoding, whichever one is higher. It's not a big deal to slightly
# underutilising or overloading your CPU. This parameter doesn't need
# to be 100% precise.
# 
# As an example, if your filtering doesn't use much CPU and you are
# using `--lp 3` on a system with 32 threads, you can set this value to
# `4 / 32 * 100` or `5 / 32 * 100` depending on the average complexity
# of the show.
# If otherwise your filtering is CPU intensive, you should observe how
# much CPU it uses and set it accordingly. For example, if your
# filtering uses somewhere between 6 to 8 threads and you're still
# using `--lp 3` for encoding, set this to `7 / 32 * 100`.
#
# An additional reminder is that you should separate filtering and
# encoding as much as possible, otherwise their will be a period when
# both filtering and encoding are consuming CPU and will certainly
# overload the system. You should not reduce `--lookahead` than default
# if you're low on RAM. In that case, just use higher `--lp`. During
# our testing, the Dispatch Server can deliver encoding speed just as
# fast using higher `--lp`s compared to `--lp 2` or `--lp 3`.
necessary_cpu = 20
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# This `required_vram` parameter denotes the maximum amount of VRAM
# used for each worker in bytes.
# 
# Run VSPipe and filter to `/dev/null` or a standalone encoder and
# observe the amount of VRAM used. You should set this slightly higher
# than the number you observe just to be on the safe side.
#
# As an example, if your filtering is observed to use around 3.5 GiB of
# VRAM, set this to 3.75 GiB or `3.75 * 1073741824` just to be on the
# safe side.
#
# If you are only using the dispatch server for optimising CPU usage
# and not VRAM, set this to `0`.
required_vram = 0.8 * 1073741824
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# It often takes time for filters to load and start processing frames.
# VRAM usage will gradually ramp up during this loading time, and it
# will be bad if we release a new worker while this is in progress. The
# dispatch server is designed to reserve the `necessary_cpu` and
# `required_vram` for newly released workers until it starts filtering
# and encoding.
# This `released_reserve_time` denotes the amount of time in
# nanoseconds during which `necessary_cpu` and `required_vram` will be
# reserved and subtracted from free CPU and VRAM calculation.
#
# Run VSPipe and observe how long it takes for it to occupy full VRAM.
# You should set this slightly higher than the amount of time you
# observe since the loading speed will be longer when CPU is near full.
# If at any time during the actual encoding that too much workers have
# been released that VRAM is completly exhausted, provided that you've
# set `required_vram` properly, increase this number.
# 
# If VRAM is not your issue and you're only using the dispatch server
# to optimise CPU usage, set it to something in the range of 1 to 2
# seconds or `1 * 1000000000` to  `2 * 1000000000`.
released_reserve_time = 5 * 1000000000
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# If you're not using a NVIDIA GPU, search for `nvml` in this script
# and replace it with a monitoring tool for your GPU brand.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Set the port used by the dispatch server. You can set it to any port
# of your preference, as long as you set it the same in `Server.py`,
# `Server-Shutdown.py` and your filtering vpy script.
port = 18861
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# You can set the maximum amount of CPU used for the dispatch server to
# release a new thread by setting "USAGE" in environment variable. This
# is for the case you want to perform other task on the system while
# the encoding is running. As an example, to only release a new worker
# when CPU dips below 60, run `USAGE=60 python Dispatch-Server.py &`.
